  <item>DAYS &amp; TIMES: The app displays ongoing events with a green background,
    future events yellow, and ended events gray.
    To change the displayed day, swipe left and right from the main schedule or
    select
    a day from the drop down in the action bar.
    \n\nCUSTOMIZE SCHEDULE: Touch the star to the left of an event to add it to "My Events"
    list at the top of each day. Use the main menu to access "Created Events,"
    where you can add custom events to your schedule, and "Filter,"
    where you can select which tournaments and convention events are displayed
    in your schedule. Touch an hour group to show/hide all events
    starting that hour, or long press to additionally show/hide all following
    hour groups. Ongoing events for a given hour are included in the group header.
    \n\nMAP: To view the hotel map,
    select an event location, which is underlined like a link,
    or search for a room via "Search" in the main menu.
    If the room is in the hotel, it will flash on the map.
    \n\nSAVING: Schedule filter, app settings, tournament finishes, event notes, etc.
    are all saved automatically, so do not worry about losing your settings!
    \n\nOTHER: If an event does not have a format or class (i.e. non-tournament events),
    then that text field will not be shown. For tournament finishes,
    finishes awarding plaques are in bold while laurels are in italics.
    \n\nPlease contact dev@boardgamers.org with any further questions.
  </item>
  <item>The
    schedule on the main screen is a chronological
    listing of events by order of appearance.
    Junior Events are listed first, highlighted by a
    symbol and are in green. Open Gaming, including
    Scheduled Open Games (SOG), and other
    non-tournament games are listed in orange. Nongaming
    events, such as meetings, registration, and
    the auction, are listed in blue. Seminars are listed
    in purple. Demonstrations are listed in black, italics.
    Advanced rounds that require prior qualification,
    such as Finals, are listed in red.
    “PC” indicates that an event is part of a Pre-
    Con and is limited to Tribune members or
    those with a badge good for that particular
    “PC” day.
    \n\nWhen more than one event starts at the same
    time, non-tournament events are listed first,
    followed by tournaments—both in alphabetical
    order. An alphabetical list of tournaments
    can be found in search screen via the main menu.
  </item>
  <item>Abbreviations for dates are Mo:
    Monday, Tu: Tuesday, We: Wednesday,
    Th: Thursday, Fr: Friday, Sa: Saturday, Su:
    Sunday. “PC Sa” or “PC Su” indicates
    that events occur on the Saturday or
    Sunday before WBC begins. Separate admission
    is required for Non-Tribune Members for
    all Pre-Cons.
  </item>
  <item>Times are listed in military time;
    e.g., 11 or 1100 is 11 am and 13 or 1300 is 1 pm. Tournament
    play commences at the scheduled times for
    each event and may run past midnight. No
    event may start a round after midnight (exception:
    our five night enders) or reconvene
    before 9 am without the consent of all remaining
    players.
  </item>
  <item>“H1/3” indicates the
    heat number out of the total number of
    heats. “R1/6” indicates the round number
    out of the estimated total number of rounds.
    A “-” instead of a “/” in the Round listing
    indicates that the rounds are continuous,
    starting immediately after the end of
    the preceding round. Heats are multiple
    starts of an event’s preliminary (qualifying)
    round. Players may play in as many heats as
    they wish, win or lose. Rounds often require
    players to qualify to advance to the next
    round. Players wishing to withdraw even
    if they qualify for the next round should
    inform the GM. Players who wish to enter
    an event in an advanced round must have
    the permission of the GM. “PC” indicates
    an event that begins during the Pre-Con but
    may end during WBC proper.
  </item>
  <item>Play is restricted
    to players who have qualified for these
    rounds. For “SF/F,” the Final immediately follows
    the semifinal. Final rounds may be rescheduled
    by the GM for the mutual benefit
    of the finalists. Such rescheduling requires the
    agreement of ALL remaining players without
    pressure to do so, otherwise the scheduled
    time is the default. Those who can’t abide by
    it must forfeit. Players who fail to appear for
    advanced rounds forfeit any claim on prizes
    or laurels that pass instead to those who advance
    in their place.
  </item>
  <item>1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is the number
    of places receiving plaques; 2 through 6 are
    Century events.
  </item>
  <item>There are three classes of tournaments:
    \n\nA: Experienced Players Only—red Kiosks;
    rules are not taught before or during play;
    \n\nB: Beginners Allowed—yellow kiosks;
    game will be taught ONLY at the listed Demo
    time. For subsequent rounds, the Class is A;
    \n\nC: Coached—green kiosks; game will
    be taught during or just prior to event start
    in event location. Once past the Preliminary
    round, the Class is always A.
  </item>
  <item>All teaching sessions take
    place in Paradise Terrace at the listed Table
    #. For B Class Events, anyone new to a game
    must attend. For C Class Event s, attending a
    scheduled demo places less stress on the GM
    and the event. If no one arrives for a demo
    within 15 minutes of the scheduled starting
    time, the demo is cancelled. This year, Previews
    and Scheduled Open Gaming have been
    added to the demo area. Previews are demos
    without a corresponding event; designers
    showing their upcoming games either as an
    adjunct to anticipated Kick Starter campaigns
    or extended playtesting opportunities. Doing
    so in the Demo area allows us to relieve pressure
    on the Open Gaming area while at the
    same time benefitting everyone with scheduled
    opportunities to gather players without
    tying up tables trolling for interest.
  </item>
  <item>SOG makes
    use of the demo tables in Paradise Assembly
    during down times to allow players to schedule
    multi-player Open Gaming opportunities which
    actually get listed in the convention schedule
    and have supporting signage and a reserved
    table provided they have made the request before
    June. To reserve a place in the referenced
    game, you should list your badge number in the
    game’s signup block on the yellow Schedule kiosk
    for that table in Paradise assembly.
  </item>
  <item>FORMAT: Before playing an event, check the
    Event Preview at boardgamers.org/yearbkex,
    the event kiosk, or via the tournament screen in the app by selecting
    an event or searching for that tournament. The Event Preview contains
    the details about how the event will run, any
    special tournament rules, the number of players
    who qualify to advance, and any tie-breakers in
    use. Most events become SE during subsequent
    rounds. Any questions about format should be
    directed to the GM BEFORE the event begins.
    Standard tie-breakers apply to events run with
    heats. They are described on our website’s GM
    Guidelines page and in event Previews.
    \n\nFF: Free Form—Contact GM at the
    listed times for flexible scheduling.
    SE: Single Elimination—play until you
    lose one game.
    \n\nSwEl: Swiss Elimination—play all
    preliminary rounds; qualifiers advance
    to SE rounds.
    \n\nSEM: SE with Mulligan Round—the
    Mulligan is an optional Round 1 that
    forgives losses. Winners advance
    directly to Round 2. Non-winners may
    play again in the regularly scheduled
    Round 1 with no penalty.
    \n\nSWISS: Play all rounds paired against
    those with same record.
    HWO: Heat Winners Only—enter any
    number of preliminary heats; winners
    only advance to next round.
    \n\nHMW: Heats Most Wins—enter any
    number of heats; qualifiers advance to SE
    rounds; first tiebreaker is most wins (e.g.,
    total in all heats entered). The remaining
    tiebreakers are 2) win in first Heat
    entered; 3) win in second Heat entered; 4)
    win in third Heat entered; 5) win in fourth
    Heat entered; 6) GM specific tiebreaker,
    provided it has been clearly described in
    the Event Preview; 7) average finish in all
    heats entered (e.g., a 2nd and two 3rds =
    2.67 and beats two 2nds and two 4ths = 3);
    and 8) high dice roll.
    \n\nHMWG: Heats Most Wins GM—enter
    any number of heats; qualifiers advance
    to SE rounds; first tiebreaker is most
    wins; GM specifies other tiebreakers.
    \n\nHSW: Heats Single Win—enter any
    number of preliminary heats; qualifiers
    advance to SE rounds; first tiebreaker
    is win in first heat entered. The second
    tiebreaker is 2) Most Wins (e.g., total
    in all heats entered). The third through
    eighth tiebreakers are the same as HMW.
    \n\nHMSE: Heats Multiple SE—each heat
    is played SE in continuous rounds to
    determine one winner who advances to
    the next round.
    \n\nSOG: Scheduled Multi-Player Open
    Gaming. The number of possible
    players is indicated by a number
    followed by “P” after the name of the
    event.
    \n\nPreview: Non-event demonstration.
  </item>
  <item>
    The duration of the event in hours.
    Round lengths are rounded up to the next hour.
    Actual allowed playing time is determined by
    the GM and should always be less than the
    scheduled period.
  </item>
  <item>
    If an image of two rotating
    arrows appears in the
    Length column, the event continues immediately
    into the next round upon completion of
    a round. The only interruption is at midnight,
    when rounds continue the following morning at
    9. GMs may grant breaks between rounds of no
    more than one hour, but only if the event is on
    schedule and such breaks are applied uniformly
    for all entrants, such that each round starts and
    ends simultaneously (e.g., some players may
    not be allowed a break that allows them to trail
    the rest of the field and delay the tournament).
  </item>
  <item>
    A map—displaying a multilevel
    floorplan of the Lancaster Host—can be found
    by selecting an underlined room location
    from any screen of the app. GrognardCon Pre-Con events shift
    from Heritage to Conestoga 1 beginning at 9 am
    on Wednesday. Otherwise, continuous round
    Events start again the next day in the same room
    unless listed elsewhere in the schedule.
